//! Command built-in
//!
//! The **`command`** built-in executes a utility bypassing shell functions.
//! This is useful when you want to execute a utility that has the same name as
//! a shell function. The built-in also has options to search for the location
//! of the utility.
//!
//! # Synopsis
//!
//! ```sh
//! command [-p] name [argumentsâ€¦]
//! ```
//!
//! ```sh
//! command -v|-V [-p] name
//! ```
//!
//! # Description
//!
//! Without the `-v` or `-V` option, the `command` built-in executes the utility
//! specified by the *name* with the given *arguments*. This is similar to the
//! execution of a simple command, but the shell functions are not searched for
//! the *name*.
//!
//! With the `-v` or `-V` option, the built-in identifies the type of the *name*
//! and, optionally, the location of the utility. The `-v` option prints the
//! pathname of the utility, if found, and the `-V` option prints a more
//! detailed description of the utility.
//!
//! # Options
//!
//! The **`-p`** option causes the built-in to search for the utility in the
//! standard search path instead of the current `$PATH`.
//!
//! The **`-v`** option identifies the type of the command name and prints the
//! pathname of the utility, if found.
//!
//! The **`-V`** option identifies the type of the command name and prints a
//! more detailed description of the utility.
//!
//! # Operands
//!
//! The ***name*** operand specifies the name of the utility to execute or
//! identify. The ***arguments*** are passed to the utility when executing it.
//!
//! # Standard output
//!
//! When the `-v` option is given, the built-in prints the following:
//!
//! - The absolute pathname of the utility, if found in the search path.
//! - The utility name itself, if it is a special built-in, function, or shell
//!   reserved word, hence not subject to search.
//! - A command line that would redefine the alias, if the name is an alias.
//!
//! When the `-V` option is given, the built-in describes the utility in a more
//! descriptive, human-readable format. The exact format is not specified here
//! as it is subject to change.
//!
//! Nothing is printed if the utility is not found.
//!
//! # Errors
//!
//! It is an error if the specified utility is not found or cannot be executed.
//!
//! # Exit status
//!
//! Without the `-v` or `-V` option, the exit status is that of the utility
//! executed. If the utility is not found, the exit status is 127. If the
//! utility is found but cannot be executed, the exit status is 126.
//!
//! With the `-v` or `-V` option, the exit status is 0 if the utility is found
//! and 1 if not found.
//!
//! # Portability
//!
//! POSIX requires that the `name` operand be specified, but many
//! implementations allow it to be omitted, in which case the built-in does
//! nothing.
//!
//! When the utility is not found with the `-v` or `-V` option, some
//! implementations return a non-zero exit status other than 1, especially 127.
//!
//! When the utility is not found with the `-V` option, some implementations
//! print an error message to the standard output while others to the standard
//! error.
